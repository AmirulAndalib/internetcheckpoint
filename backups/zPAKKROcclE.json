Kinda has inspired me.\n\nI'm Spanish, 21 years old. 18th and 19th years had been the worst ones I've lived so far. After I finished bachelore, I got into a vocational training on medicine - Thing I didn't like at all, but my father really insisted on it. Of course I failed and didn't dare returning home after a wasted year. Once I did, the stress was too overwhelming and my parents still kept putting too much pressure on me that, for the first time in my life, thoughts on planning for suicide drove right into my mind. The next year was also a waste, but at my 20th year I started studying programming only having a very small base on what all of it was about. Luckily for me, I met there a friend who I could perfectly consider as my best friend right now who has helped me through this degree and finally made that year not to be a complete waste. Life's been doing better since then: I've got a new group of friends after the last one left me alone for two years and I've known nothing from them since then - Not that I ever want to. My new group is the most warming and friendly I've been, and I owe them all a lot. We can't see eachother much due to the actual covid situation, but we always hang out in discord whenever we can to play some games, do some tabletop roleplaying such as D&D, or just simply stay there and talk about life. My parents also accept me more now and we get along really well, and I'm really happy that I can make them proud of me. I wouldn't ask for anything else at all. However, this last year is being stressful as heck: in our classes, a teacher that helped us the most that was supposed to teach us for another year isn't in our actual degree, and instead we have a really demanding one who gives us lots of works to do in very few time. I have to finish about 4 different projects in under 5 days at the moment I'm writting this down, and the caffeine levels in my veins are burning hot to use the most time I can have. And here I am, writting down this long personal story of mine, gathered in this fireplace of people I don't know at all. But your stories, your worries, your ups and downs... You've all inspired me to keep going and not fall behind, not after all the efforts I've made this far. These are gonna be the roughest 5 days of this year for sure, but I can't let it all go to waste now!\n\n\nSo that's why I wanted to write this down, maybe to share my story along with the other hundreds of stories I've read so far, and so I can hopefully inspire some of you too. Life can have great downhills, but all you gotta do is look for the right people, the right times, and no matter how many years it takes, things can always climb up to bettter places. Wherever you are, whoever you are, I wish you the best that could happen to ya.\n\n...oh, and I'll be sure to write down here again after these 5 days if everything goes right. Good luck ya'll! ¬°Buena suerte a todos! <3", "time": "2 n√§dala eest", "channel": "UCwVOiB5Li3A-1l1hIVhIJKw"}

Which certainly helped me know why I feel like I live my life from someone else's POV, but honestly that isn't even it now. I struggle to maintain any semblance of a relationship with a borderline abusive family that constantly belittle and breate for doing things that they taught me to do over my near 22 year life. I am confident once the lockdowns and pandemic either ease up or end I can have a chance to get away from them, even if only temporarily. But thankfully, there is finally some news in this checkpoint. I have met the boy of my dreams. I won't get into specifics, but what started as a spur of the moment \"wanna try?\" sort of internet relationship has blossomed into something more and I couldn't be happier. So while this checkpoint is still mostly sad, at least there is some good in the world. I know life is tough and honestly fucking sucks ass at times. I'm just glad I was able to experience some semblance of happiness this time. Since my last checkpoint, I am also getting therapy and counselling, even if scarce and sparce, but I haven't had an attempt in months. Fuck, im crying while I write this since my life has changed this drastically in just a few months.\nI apologise if you read all that, but I thank you for listening to my story. \nAnd to me of the future when i inevitably end up back here. It does get better. It may take some time, there may not be any sunshine around the corner. But there will ALWAYS be a light at the end of the tunnel.\nStay safe everyone, i love you x\n~Rai  04/02/2021", "time": "2 kuu eest", "channel": "UCPzNzdMql3oEUhL2z7h82Mw"}

I never had particulary great marks, but because of lazyness and constant technical problems during online class, I am now worried about getting my AHR (Allgemeine Hochschulereife (specific german kind of graduation)). My laptop is broken, and I don't have anything that I can use to attend to classes. I don't know what to do, and I currently don't want to do anything. My grandparents spent a lot of money on the PC that I have saved up for years building. The only thing missing is a GPU. I have the money for it, but it is really hard to get your hands on any of the new GPUs. My grandma only wanted one thing from me. In order to make up for the money they gave me, they wanted to see good/ok grades. At that point I promised that I won't disappoint them. And here I am now, worr, Ing about my graduation, not feeling mentally able to do anything. I skipped more lessons than in the 5 previous years. I really don't want to dissapoint anyone.

First time I dare to write, it might be the nostalgy of playing this level and loving all about it (including the trilogy as well), or may well be that now I'm literally to the other half of the world (18.998 km in distance with geodesy straight direction)\nIve already pass by the 27 yo, this year 28 (the famous 27s club is not my thing, I reckon), my life is not full of luxury or lack of needs; but Ive never experienced prolonged hunger, since child I was the promise of my family (supposedly more intelligent than other Childs), and whilst growing, a model for others regarding my academic consistency and willingness (for many things). I was awardee in my undergraduate, now Im also have a full  post-graduate scholarship in this new country, before Ive never suffered unemployment, just before leaving my country I had to reject various offerings (following my \"dreams\"). Ive never had to look for much attention to girls (my physical appearance is in normal standards), but I have been able to date and get companionship with no much effort. I dont like to have too many possessions and I prefer to be alone or with a small group of friends (I make it and lost it so easily). I don't have any illness and my mental stability is tremendously tenacious. (I have supported and advise many lives, in certain way I can say I literally have saved lives; so many of them admire my \"wisdom\")\nIt can be said that I don't have any problem; however, there is something, something inside my that is revolting since very early times in my life: I am not able to stop questioning everything. After, I think, my 22 yo, those questions, with a more mature context and with a broader vision of life have become more intense/fundamental, after 26 yo and especially now I am dealing with the existence of my-self and all other things. I feel loosing my-self in which other may assure \"trivial\", I think the more the time pass by, the more senseless my life becomes, I lost my drive (and my willingness now is conditioned to temporary contexts), it is like the meaning of all the things I have done for me and others is vague. Why am I doing all the good and the bad? Why am I believing that I need to find a real \"meaning of life\"? \nI don't have problems with enjoying life, I feel all the range the emotions, the good and bad emotions, I have suffered as many of us the violence of this world, the love of this one also; however If I stop for a moment and meditate about it, sometimes the outcomes is the doubt instead of desired peace; and this doubt feeds  my permanent vacillation (the dichotomy: all matters, nothing matters) and the result, progressively push me towards something I do not know what it is, but somehow I fear and it seems to be that my life is objectively meaningless.", "time": "4 kuu eest", "channel": "UCjdNzeJ__YIqdNEvyICXX-A"}

[Y/N]:y\r\nI'm slowly falling out of love with someone I thought I knew for half my life, though we've never met face-to-face. I don't know exactly how it happened, but I have a suspicion that we're both changing - myself, after having embraced one ideology, and her after finding new friends who nudged her in the opposite direction. I like some of those new friends. I strongly dislike others. Her closest new friend is a rabid partisan who tries to shut down any argument which isn't going her way, and will try to browbeat you if she so much as smells an opinion which offends her sensibilities. She's an admin in the only discord server I share with my \"internet SO\", and once threatened to ban me for saying the wrong word. A couple of weeks ago, my \"internet SO\" posted a take on recent events I found so incredibly troubling I found myself questioning my feelings toward her, and after that and other discussions we had before that, she hasn't been as sweet on me as she used to. The feeling is... mutual, I guess. What worries me isn't that I'm losing her - what worries me is that it doesn't worry me as much as I suspect it should.\r\n\r\nYet, as my virtual love life declines, my work life has never been better. I've turned over a new leaf, so to speak, and all signs point to a significant pay rise. I've taken on more and more challenging tasks, and no matter how frustrated they sometimes make me, it's intensely rewarding to see my expertise result in success. I've also taken my finances into my own hands, and stopped living paycheck-to-paycheck in order to save. I have a nest egg, now, and if everything goes right, I'll be rolling in it when I'm a little old lady. Granddad named me in his will despite being very against me when I came out. I feel like I (mostly) have control of my life. I'm stepping into my 30s knowing exactly who and what I am, and what the world means to me. I'm never perfectly balanced, but I know how to strive for balance. I just have to figure out how to cut out the last parts I don't have control of.\r\n\r\nOr, failing that, drink an entire bottle of \"Divalicious Pink Pinot\" and shitpost on Twitter about them.\r\n\nCheckpoint saved!\r\n9/24/2020 1:15 AM", "time": "6 kuu eest (muudetud)", "channel": "UC35Wz1PNtINQ70Xh6rgvUyQ"}

We used to scramble far and wild across the neighborhood, hoping fences, going to areas restricted to access. But there's a place I recall, that I go to in my dreams, but didn't actually exist in the places I once physically visited when I was still young. In the dream, there are giant plants called elephant ears sprouting, and a massive chasm in the ground, and forests everywhere. From the chasm is such a gale, it sweeps you off your feet if you're not cautious and you can tumble down into this mammoth pit. The gusts are so strong on some days due to the weather, you can get on one of the wide elephant ear leaves and ride it across. It's terrifying, if the wind stalls you'll drop, but usually the gust continues without too dire of interruption and you can skitter across this sprawling pit. I love this dream, it's exhilarating, and there's so much nostalgia for this place that only exists in my dreams. When I'm dreaming of it, though, then it feels like it always was a genuine place that actually existed, that I could find somewhere out there if I searched long enough. Despite it being a frightening realm to visit when I slumber, i feel like times are still simple, and the once ways were never set asunder. But if I don't continue from my last save point, I will never reach the end of my journey. Tomorrow will never come.\n[Save Progress]\n>Y\n  N", "time": "6 kuu eest", "channel": "UCatr4iuJ7ObfCiQkI6YBvRw"}

I was living in a apartment that I had grown accustomed to. I was living there for a couple of years in a small room I could assume used to be a large closet. It was big enough to fit a Queen Size bed, there was barely any room at the sides for me to walk, so i had to walk across my bed to do stuff. It was a cramped room but it didn‚Äôt bother me that much. Being at home is my habitat anyways. I never liked the outside. Well, exception being winter. But that‚Äôs irrelevant.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùMy mother has grown sick to one of my brother‚Äôs antics. Constantly letting homeless people in without her permission, constantly doing drugs that causes the place to smell of pot (I was next to his room, so i could smell it from the vent). Eventually she has grown tired of it. She began to search for a new house away from my brother‚Äôs antics to hope to find peace instead of being constantly in fear of what people he may bring in. Eventually, she found a place. It was a two story house with a basement. Nothing too fancy. And luckily, affordable for her price range. So thats good.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùWhen it was time to leave, it took about 3 days to get everything we needed out of the apartment. 6 trips in total with the large company truck we had to borrow to make all of this possible. My brother didn‚Äôt help since it‚Äôs none of his business. But the rest of the family helped out. Unfortunately, i could only help so much before getting exhausted quickly and forced to take many breaks under 90 degree weather conditions. That, and my lack of exercise for the past months of quarantine. We had to carry stuff down to the back of the truck from a two story flight of stairs. I could only make 2-4 trips before getting exhausted. Admittedly, the stuff was pretty heavy to carry down. So it did brought stress on my legs. But everyone else was doing it with little to no problems. It made me feel incompetent compared to the rest of my family...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùBut still. Despite the conditions, i still tried to help out with what i could muster from my remaining stamina. I would rather help everyone out instead of doing jack shit and shit around just taking in oxygen and converting it into carbon dioxide... **Sigh**... Curse my lack of stamina... Sure i had strength and such. I can participate is sports and compete against athletes. I just lack the endurance and techniques that they have over me. It‚Äôs a shame that i had my mother pay someone who lived near to us (down in the store probably) to help us with the moving. While we all do appreciate it, its mainly because of me. I couldn‚Äôt survive a solid minute of carrying furniture and the like down the steps without getting exhausted. It‚Äôs my fault for being such a lazy ass and have my family struggle while I struggle against some steps... They told me to drink a lot of water. I get the point of me being hydrated is important and all, but it ain‚Äôt a stamina potion... Heh, it‚Äôs like they expect me to go ‚ÄúALRIGHT, I‚ÄôM ALL BETTER NOW! LETS KEEP GOING EVERYONE!‚Äù as i yell in herculean strength. Muscles bulging out of my shirt and shit. Heh...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùHah... Luckily, we managed to finish the packing and dropping everything off here. We got everything we need in our new home. Just... We gotta unpack a lot of the garbage bags downstairs and some crates before our job is done. Then our home is considered a official home. If i were to be honest, i don‚Äôt really mind the state that we‚Äôre in. Sure, Mother would like to unpack everything, but i‚Äôm content with our home right now. My mattress is set up, furniture is placed around the house in their planned spots, all is good. Really, all we need to do is unpack all of the small stuff... Despite there being... I dunno, rough estimate here; 100-ish bags? Needless to say, theres a lot to unpack. But it will get done. Tell you that much.‚Äù\n\n‚Äù... **Sigh**... I need to start moving more. Those 3 days of packing were absolutely pathetic of me.‚Äù\n\n[-]==================================================[-]\n\n*[-]Checkpoint SAVED[-]", "time": "7 kuu eest", "channel": "UCHKwUpnmq9wVTRJTJhj8V5g"}

The only motivation I have for doing schoolwork is just to get good grades on my final tests. I need to attend classes and on top of that study for the final exams. I'll probably do fine on the most part, but I'm worried about math and physics. I'm painfully average at math and my brother was about as good at that stuff and he got shit for grades from those tests. It's likely that I screw up and don't get the grades I wanted.\nI saw a comment here that was talking about similar stuff and I want to say that I know that feel. \n\nI've talked about school and other worries with many people already. \r\nMost importantly my father has already disclosed that he's not disappointed even if I screw up, though he said that it does make him somewhat sad to see me struggle. However we are different people and my success or lack thereof has no bearing on his life. That conversation was super relieving.\n\nI don't know where my life is going. I don't know what kind of postgraduate studies I'll even do. I just hope that after all this I'll get a job I don't hate so that I can eat, workout and have electricity in my future apartment.

One of my close friends was leaving for Colorado and i would only be able to talk to him with discord. But when i was sent home i suddenly was filled with immense willpower to start getting my life together. I am currently sitting at around 190 pounds after losing around 40+ pounds from where i started and i feel a lot better about myself. Prom was cancelled at the high school i went to, but because i had already asked a girl to prom and she said yes, my family threw a kind of mini-prom. She said that she had a crush on me before she went home and i told her that i felt the same way for her. It became a regular thing of her coming over once every one or two weeks. And eventually ahe became my girlfriend. I've kept in touch with my friends more than usual, and we started playing tf2 together again, which we haven't done since my freshman year of high school. But now i feel like its a calm before a storm. I just graduated and am going to start having to go to my college's band camp in a few days and start actual college the week after the next. I'm going into new territory, but I know I'm stronger now and am prepared for what life will throw at me. I just hope it doesnt throw too hard.\n\nAugust 14\n2020\n11:43 PM\n\nWe're going to make it\n„ÄäGame Saved„Äã\n   See you later!", "time": "7 kuu eest", "channel": "UC75IVy_6tbOHwn1ZdxZu12Q"}

I had depression years ago, and managed to get myself back on my feet. I feel like I'm slipping back into it. \r\n\r\nPassing, joking, comments about how I live off public programs since graduating college, dig deeper than intended, I waste my talent and ideas on playing games. As a high-risk individual I'm imprisoned in my own home during the pandemic. The desire to create something lasting with my life and my youth is finally there, but I cannot go out and pursue it safely. My self-worth is eroding. Being a good friend and a good son isn't sustaining me anymore. I want to contribute my life experiences to the world, but I feel unable to do so right now. It is suffocating.\r\n\r\nI keep telling myself ill start pushing as hard as I can to escape this feeling, but I wake up and the weight is almost too much to bear.

I've been extremely homesick the last few weeks, but I've been finding ways around it. I really do like my new place.\n\nThe DKC2 ost reminds me a lot of when I first moved to the place I'm leaving now. I really didn't listen to much other music at the time (not a fact I'm super proud of but eh,) so it has always been really nostalgic to me. It speaks of a much simpler time in my life. The soundtrack is so beautiful and ambient, while still having such banger melodies to keep it all moving. It really does take me to another world.\n\nThings are pretty bad right now, but I'm glad it hit when it did for me. The end of last year was the first time when I really felt mentally and physically comfortable and even proud of who I am and was in the past, flaws and all. So if the world really wanted to knock my mental state down a few pegs, I'm glad it was during a time where I could handle it in a healthy way rather than say, late 2018 lol. I'm doing fine right now. There have been a few dark patches, but it's nowhere near the worst I've been. I'll get through this, I know I can.

Wazzap ‚úãüèΩ(black power). I graduated high school about 2 weeks ago and I feel kinda empty inside. I left my senior groupchat cause I don‚Äôt really like the people and I didn‚Äôt see the need to be in it anymore. I‚Äôm worried tho cause with corona I might not even get to go to my college campus and meet new people. That is what college is all about right? So all I have left is the people I know in New York (yerrr). I‚Äôm having a hard time making friends so ... uhh hopefully I meet more people online and develop new skills. Not sure how I‚Äôm suppose to end this checkpoint... oh! I forgot to mention that all I can think about are alternative realties. Like one where I had a relationship with my friend from elementary school. Maybe it could‚Äôve been the chance for me to have my first kiss ü§î I found her on Instagram and I don‚Äôt know how to hold a convo, but with the few messages we‚Äôve had, I‚Äôm so happy to know that she‚Äôs still the same person I liked. And this kinda goes back to me knowing only my friends in New York...idk why but I haven‚Äôt talked to them in a while. I think I‚Äôm tired of them, especially this one friend of mine, but feel obligated to answer him cause I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends. I‚Äôm not the same person as I was 4 years ago, where I had so much energy and was happier. I‚Äôm..just so tired these days. And he‚Äôs tired too so our convos don‚Äôt go anywhere. See it‚Äôs a negative times negative, no positive üòî. All he does is smoke weed and sing sza, so imagine having to listen/ see that on FaceTime until he falls asleep. Bruh. I‚Äôve always been scared to call people. My parents are exceptions, but others in general , I get so nervous. I feel like they‚Äôre doing other things, talking to other people, like I‚Äôm not the only option. So I‚Äôve been waiting for people to come to me and I want to change that. Don‚Äôt know who to call or what to say. Everything I do now, I just overthink on how I should do it, like talking. Or maybe even writing this. I‚Äôm done now. 1:36 am Saturday(s are for the boys)", "time": "9 kuu eest", "channel": "UCVzjqtr9ppLMSBFSVt4gVlw"}

I feel like every time I look in the mirror, I am looking at a stranger, someone I have never met. I have been questioning my sense of self, orientation, gender identity, and who I am.\nWhen I was maybe 13 I began to copy other people in order to try and fit, it had gotten o such a point, even my own parents didn't recognize that behavior as 'me' anymore and it began to sour my relationship with them as I grew more stubborn, more aggressive and more hateful to them and others around me. It is now at such a point where even I can't recognize myself in a mirror as all I feel is disgust towards the person I see and am calling my reflection.\nI don't know how to fix these problems and I usually don't want to talk about them so I don't bother people with problems they shouldn't have to put up with. In my 21 year life, I have had maybe 15 suicide attempts with 2 almost being successful and recently I wrote a suicide note with intent to hang myself in the woods nearby. I can't bear leaving behind those I care for and am torn if what is best is to remove the source of the problem or try and sort it out with people who I have hurt and won't listen.\nI know this is a really depressing checkpoint but it was nice to finally get some of this off my chest if you have read this far, I thank you for hearing my, admittedly depressing, story and wish you the best of luck and only the kindest of days\n\n14:57  09/07/2020\nEngland", "time": "8 kuu eest", "channel": "UCPzNzdMql3oEUhL2z7h82Mw"}

I didn't understand all the mechanics me playing betwee. 6-8 years old, and never got past them.\n\nMy Parents had a breakup when i was around 8 and I was wisked to another state, and me not knowing why i was leaving, couldnt find my GBA (I later learned since my father was being unfaithful, the kids of the other person he had over had stolen my GBA and Charger.)\n\nI never have played another game in the series simply by chance.\n\nHowever, last year, a friend got me a copy of VBA, and some ROMs for a lot of the games i liked on it.\nAmong them was DKC3.\n\nIt took me for a while to touch the game, but i finally got to it in April of this year.\n\nFor those of you who saw my posts in the Chrono Trigger checkpoints know what happned.\nI lost my Cousin who gave me my GBA, DKC3, and my Childhood to Covid-19, and I started playing the exact day he passed.\n\nAfter all the little grieving and stress that happened, I dedicated my time to finishing the game in his honor. And that's exactly what I did: 100% cleared the game alongside Krematoa in a single sitting, in 14 hours.\n\n...And that's my story for Donkey Kong. I'll share this at the checkpoints.\nIt's 2:22 am EST at the time of writing... and I can only wish you guys the best.\nPlease stay safe in these hard times... others shouldn't have to suffer the loss of you, especially if your younger.

I'm a little worried the algorithm might run out of these to give to me. I like them. I could look for them myself, though there's something about just finding them that I kind of enjoy.\n\nIn a couple of days I'll have to meet with my professor one on one to talk about some reading. I still need to do it and I'm kind of worried I'll end up procrastinating on it, but I'll try not to worry too much. I still have the weekend to do it! It'll be fine, it's just me and him working on time management over the summer.\n\nOther than that, no major plans for today. Summers tend to be laid back like that. I guess it's kind of a good thing that I have something I have to do over the next few weeks, just to give me some sort of structure even as all the days spent inside melt together and stop feeling any different.\n\nI also kind of wonder if anyone has been on the same trail of recommendations as me and seen my earlier two checkpoints. It's okay if they haven't, I just am curious about the kinds of people that are here.\n\nI'll be continuing my adventure after this. Today, that happens to mean folding laundry, haha. Not every part of a story is a grand boss fight, after all! We're all important, even if it doesn't feel like it. The universe aligned itself so that we would all be here and experience everything we have up until now.\n\nBe careful out there!

No matter what point in time you're reading this, things are probably hectic. They always seem to be. So it's important every now and then to take the time to ground yourself.\nSeparate yourself from what's going on around you, and just be comfortable in your own presence. As important as our connections to other people are, you are a complete and whole person by yourself. You are worthy of love, so give it to yourself. You've been through a lot, and you've still got more to overcome, so be nice to yourself.\nAsk yourself this: if another person treated you the way you treat yourself, how would you feel about that? Would you treat someone else the way you treat yourself? You may think you know what's best for yourself, but our minds can be deceitful. Often, we lie to ourselves, convincing ourselves that we deserve to hurt. You may not feel worthy of love, or respect, or happiness, but you are. It's okay to admit that.\nI've gone on for too long already, so I'll wrap things up. My main message for today is this: recognize your importance. Of course, not in a cocky way, but in a way where you value yourself as you value the people closest to you. You are an important person in the lives of multiple people. It may not always feel that way, but it's true. You can do so much good in this world. I know you can.\nPerhaps this comment is a little all over the place, but isn't life? Thank you for reading this long, unnecessarily deep comment. Until we meet again.", "time": "10 kuu eest", "channel": "UC-dpfVzQcH7uLFha3-jOvAw"}

It doesn‚Äôt get any easier though, I am going to be bluntly honest with you, human lives are just as equally cherished as pets lives, and to some people your life is everything to them. Thats like them losing a really good friend like you losing your dog, if you don‚Äôt have a reason to live, now you do. Please stay here with us. <3 My thoughts go out to you my friend. I hope this helped. Life gets weird sometimes.", "time": "5 kuu eest", "channel": "UC3cOxtRjkVpjrHjbrng-evA"}

It's currently 14:55PM for me here in Germany.\nFor the past two hours or so, I've been finally tying up loose ends, dealing with problems that have been there for a long, long time. I'm pretty gosh dang nervous about contacting this second, and last, person, as I'm not sure how they'll respond.\nBut I have to do this, either way. If I do this, this is the only way I can finally mark off this chapter of my life as COMPLETE. Well, this aspect, anyhow. I suppose life is just one big chapter, in a way?\n\nIt felt amazing, really fulfilling, to contact the first person and finally make a change, make a difference in how I handle these things. I feel like I've actually fulfilled something that has been a responsibility in the back of my mind for the longest time.\n\nSo I'm working on that, really, REALLY nervous about this last person, but I know I can and will make it.\nI'll do it, no doubt about it. Just scared, and that's alright!\nThere's nothing wrong with being afraid.\nDespite being scared, I'll push through, I keep moving forward through the fear, and achieve my dreams.\n\nAnd so can you, whoever's reading this. If you yearn for something, if you truly desire something, you can do the unimaginable, you can surpass the seemingly impossible. You have got this, 100%, no doubt about it.\n\nI hope you're having a fantabulous day/night, whoever's reading this, and if not, then I wish you absolute best rest of the day you can imagine!\nTomorrow's also another day, with different things happening~\nYou've got this.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I'VE DONE IT!

Now I think I'm gonna stay with my Mom. I have been going back and forth with this decision for 9 fucking years! Recently my brother who's a year older than me moved in with my dad and I know he's not gonna cooperate with my dad's lessons. But him and I are so different. I enjoy it when people make decisions for me because I don't have to choose and I can blame it on someone else if something goes wrong. But I have to decide. And soon. 9 years ago it wasn't really a problem. It was only a few years ago that my dad was really capable of caring for us. I can't even remember today. Just my phone. Frustrated with myself because of how socially inept I am. Been going back and forth listening to my \"deeper\" music aka my sad music. This one of them. Trying to hype myself up to face my social difficulties. But I won't do it today either way and the hype will be gone by tomorrow. Maybe another day. Is what I keep telling myself.

But, amidst all of this negativity, there have been some positive things, like the announcement of my new sibling. \n\nOverall, I rather not amount to be a useless person.", "time": "9 kuu eest", "channel": "UCUjapnDv_lHugM81ZHph1VA"}

I may not get to continue my education in the fall and people i know continue to risk the lives of their family members by not taking pandemic guidelines seriously. But today protesting entirely peacefully and having no violent interactions with police really makes me understand just how lucky i am in this terrible, cruel world. Seeing on twitter how vile and malicious cops can be to innocent people makes me not only understand my white privilege, but just how fantastic my circumstances are in this apocalypse that is 2020. There is an entire laundry list of events that have ruined peoples lives this year and my family and i continue to go largely unaffected. I mourn the losses of my friends and people across the nation and world and i continue to feel like a satellite floating aimlessly through space, entirely content with my position at the moment, yet lost as to what may lie beyond and wishing i could do more to help those who are hurting. My days are running together as are my thoughts, so this may have been a lot of rambling, but thank you if youve read all the way to the end of this.

Once that 500th reply hits, no more being able to tell you how our day went. But if I am to take one of these 500th spots, then so be it. It‚Äôs early morning / midnight right now and I‚Äôm up at 3 am just browsing the internet. I‚Äôll click on some YouTube videos, scroll through some explicit websites, swipe through memes on twitter, the whatever. I‚Äôll go on a comment section or some other forum and act like a total fucking jackass to see if I can, at the very least, get a reaction out of someone to intrigue my bored soul. As for other things, online classes are a total bore and pose no challenge whatsoever. I‚Äôll slouch down and play video games while everyone else babbles away at stuff. Life‚Äôs currently pretty slow considering the pandemic, winter break, and all that stuff. I don‚Äôt really have much going for me right now. If I had to describe the entire essence of what I‚Äôve been doing for the past few months, it would just be... well, waiting. I‚Äôm just waiting. Waiting for something, anything, to happen. Waiting until I grow up and have the ability to do whatever I want to do, no parents or siblings to hold me down. But then I have the fear of being alone and dying alone with no one to comfort me. I don‚Äôt have any friends to meet up with. Not online and not in person. I‚Äôll occasionally come to family meetings and sit down in a corner somewhere and wait some more till I go back home. Nothing bad has happened in my life recently. At least not yet. Nothing good has happened in my life recently. At least not yet. I don‚Äôt have any desire to off myself since I still have a few people who care about whether or not I exist. I‚Äôm lazy and overweight, weathering away with each passing second. But I guess it‚Äôs ok. No matter how frozen time may seem, I suppose I‚Äôll just keep living. Maybe I‚Äôll find a motive to seek out love. Maybe I‚Äôll find a career I‚Äôm truly passionate for.

I always try to remind myself that I don't know what's going on in their lives to make them act the way they do towards me. While I may get mad at them for the time being, I never hold on to that anger. I let it go, and go on about my day.
