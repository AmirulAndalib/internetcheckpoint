# Internet Checkpoint
An hommage to the internet checkpoint comments section.

## Introduction

[internetcheckpoint.page](https://internetcheckpoint.page/zK4TWXWEKAQ) is a modest attempt at recreating the comments sections under the video of taia777.
All the comments backups were made by [Rebane](https://www.reddit.com/r/taia777/comments/o1rls6/taia777_videos_and_comments_archive/).
